This is a one-stop-shop for all the Python programming concepts that are taught in Introduction to Computational Biology (Bio131) at Reed College. It was last updated for the Spring 2026 course.

### GitHub Codespaces (VSCode)

Bio131 currently uses GitHub and GitHub Codespaces to manage assignment and lab submissions and work. It looks like a VSCode editor.

### PythonTutor

If you are writing code and can't quite figure out why Python is doing something _other_ than what you think it should, [PythonTutor](http://pythontutor.com/) is an **excellent** resource.  It allows you to run your code step-by-step, observing what is stored in memory and what is printed to the console.
